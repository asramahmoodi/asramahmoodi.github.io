    <p>assignment6- Internet Fundamentals/ Networking
    Activity1- Fix Wi-Fi connections in Windows.
    In this activity, I have learned about common internet connection issues such as slow internet, no internet access, missing wi-fi options, or frquently dropping connections. It explained the use of command prompt command(for example, TCP/IP stack, flushing DNS) and running troubleshooters to fix connectivity issues. The activity also explained updating and reinstalling network adapter drivers, checking for Windows updates, and performing network resets.
    I can apply this skils to resolve connectivity issues for my device or for my family memebers devices like network troubleshooter, checking wi-fi connection status, etc. In my work environment, I can apply this skills to create a more efficient network management system, minmize downtime, and help others to rsolve connectivity problems.
    Activity2- Research, Identify and describe the necessary components required to set up a home network.
    In this activity, I have research and learned how to set up a home network. For this, I need a modem to connect to a ISP, a router to manage traffic between devices on my network, and Ethernet cables to physically connect devices, with the option to add a network switch for more wired connections and wireless access point if I want to connect wireless devices. I may also need a firewall for added security. Modem converts the analog signal from ISP into a digital signal that my home network can understand. Router, acts as the central hub of my network, directing internet traffic between connected devices and providing both wired and wireless connections. Ethernet cablies, physical wires used to connect devices like computers, game console, and network switches to the router for a wired connections. Networkin Switches, this device allows multiple devices to connect to a network simultaneously, efficiently managing data flow between them. Wireless access point, enables wireless connectivity by broadcasting a wi-fi signal that devices can connect to.
    I can apply this skills to set up a home network in my personal environment. In my work environment, to set up a network, I don't have to rely on others, and I can fix network issues by myself. By learning this skills I can also start small business setup to help other people in setting up networks for their needs.</p>
