    Activity- Introduction to HTML
    In this activity, I have learned the fundamental of HTML, which is essential for creating web pages. The core elements like<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, ,<body>, <title>, and <p> are the building blocks of a web page. HTML uses elements(tags) to define content types such as headings, paragraphs, links, etc. HTML consists of start tags, content, and ending tags. Some elements like,<br> don't have content or ending tags. These are known as empty elements. Web browsers read HTML and display the content but do not show the tags. HTML has evolved over time with multiple versions HTML2.0, HTML3.2, HTML4.01, XHTML, AND HTML5. Each bringing new features to better support web content.
    I can apply this learning to my personal environment by creating my personal portfolio or blog using basic HTML. I can build a web page with headings, paragraphs, and images to display my work or hobby. In my work environment, I can apply this learning for creating online reports or presentation. HTML can help me format text, embed media, and create links.</p>
