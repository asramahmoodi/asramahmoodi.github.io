    <p>assignment15a- Activity- Career Planning and Salary</p>
    <p> In this activity, I have learned that when exploring a career, it's important to research the types of position available, average working conditions, salary expectations, and future job outlook. Effective career planning requires thorough research using a variety of tools like the Occupational Outlook, CareereOneStop, and MyNextmove provide essential information such as job outlook, salary ranges, required education, and typical working conditions. I also learned the importance of gathering first-hand insight through job shadowing, interviews, internships, or volunteering, as well as the value of attending career fairs, and joining industry organization.</p>
    <p>Personally, I will use these resources to identify careers that work with my skills, interests and long-term goals. I plan to create a creere plan using CareerOneStop and explore industries with strong growth. Finding a suitable job of my interest can enhance my performance and help in future growth. I will also share these resources to my co=workers who are interested in prfessional development, helping them plan their career paths.</p>
