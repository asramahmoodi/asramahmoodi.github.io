    <p>assignment8b- Internet Fundamentals/web accessibility
    Activity1- what is accessibility?
    From this activity, I have learned the importance of accessibility in web development, focusing on making websites usable for as many people as possible, especially those with disabilities. I now understand that accessibility is not just about people with disabilities, but also improving user experience for everyone, including mobile users and people with slow internet connections. When designing a website, I need to consider various things such as visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive impairments. Accessibility is a legal requirement in many countries, and failing to comply could lead to legal consequences. I also learned about the importance of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG) and the role of accessibility APIs in helping developers tp create accessible websites.
    In my personal environment, I will do accessibility practices from the begining of my project, such as ensuring the content is accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies. In my work environment, I will encourage for accessibility to be considered during the planning of web development projects. Also, I will educate my team about WCAG guidelines.</p>
