    Session4- Internet Fundamentals/email
    Activity1- Mozilla Thunderbird.
    In this activity, I have learned that Mozilla Thunderbird is a free open-source email client that offers a variety of features beyond just sending and receiving emails. It has a personal information manager, integrated calendar, and contact book functionalities as well as supports RSS feed, instant messaging, and news.Thunderbird is maintained by Thunderbird council, with contributions from a global community. It's available across multiple platforms including, Windows, MacOs, Linux, FreeBSD, and android making it highly accessible. It has Add-ons features which allows users to customize and to extend it's capabilities. Thunderbird supports major email protocols like POP3 and IMAP.It has more features like spam filtering and advanced message organization. Thunderbird prioritize security with options like encrypted email, remote image blocking, and disabling Javascript for enhancing privacy.
    By knowing this alternative, I will take advantage of thunderbird in my both personal and professional environments because of it's security and privacy features. I would rely on it's encryption and anti-spam features for safe communications. Additionally, as I manage multiple email accounts, thunderbird's ability to support multiple identities and account types could help me communicate effectively and reduce clutter.
    Activity2-email spoofing.
    In this activity, I have learned that email spoofing is an act of creating fake email messages that appears to come from trusted senders but are actually from an unknown or malicious source. This is possible because traditional email system like SMTP don't authenticate the senders address. As a result email recipient can be tricked into thinking the message is legitimate and can cause serious consequences such as phishing attacks, malware distribution, or business email compromise scams. Furthermore, this kind of attacks are used by cybercriminals to gain trust and trick recipients to open attachments, providing sensitive information, and transferring money. In addition, there are countermeasures like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, these system aren't foolproof. Despite of awareness of these issues, email spoofing is a big cybersecurity challenge.
    In terms of applying this knowledge, it is important to be cautious about any emails I receive, specially those that ask for sensitive information or financial transfer. I would make use of advanced email security protocols in both personal and professional environments.
