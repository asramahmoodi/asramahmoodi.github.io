    <h1>assignment7- Intenet Fundamentals/Security<h1>
    <p>Activity1- Internet Safety.
    In this activity, I have learned that simple passwords like birthdays or common patterns are very vulnerable. A good password should be long, contain a mix of numbers, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase letters, and be unpredictable. Using personal information like family member's names, birthdays, or addresses can easily compromise security. I also learned that reusing the same password on multiple sites increases the risk if one account is hacked. Tools like password generators and password managers are valueable for creating and storing strong password security. I also learned about the significance of checking a website's address for legitimacy, especially avoiding misleading URLs. The locks symbol in the browser's address bar (HTTPS) signals a secure website. I understand that keeping my browser updated helps protect against the security threats.
    I will apply this concept in my personal environment, will start using longer, more complex passwords for my accounts, and avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or names of family members. I will also use a password manager to keep track of these password securely. At work, I will ensure that my work-related accounts and systems are protected with strong, unique passwords, espicially for sensitive data. I will encourage my colleagues to do the same.
    Activity2-Comparison of Antivirus Software.
    In this activity, I have learned about different antivirus features and how they can contribute to overall security like scan types, On-demand scan- manual scan initiated by the users. On-access scan- real time, automatic scan that occur when files are created or modified. Boot-time scans- scans conducted during the system's boot process to catch malware that could hide while the system is running. Additional security features like Cloud AV- automatic scanning cloud resources often for more up-to-dtae resource efficient threat detection. Email security protection from email based threats like malware, phishing, and scams. Antispam protection specially against harmful emails. I also learned about a detailed comparison of various products, their features, and the countries of origin. For example, Avast, AVG, Bitdefender, and Norton are well known antivirus brands, and I can see features are included such as Cloud AV or Firewall protection in their different version.
    I can apply this to my personal environment by selecting a suitable antivirus based on the features I need. For example, if I frequently use email or social media, prioritizing email security and antispam. In my work environment, I can apply all-around protection, particularly if my company or organization deals with sensitive information. By applying these learnings, I can better protect my personal devices and work environment from various security threats, and improving overall safety.</p>
