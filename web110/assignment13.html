  <h1>assignment 13- summary</h1>
    <p>In this session, I have learned about project management skills which is crucial to complete a project successfully. Project management evolves around five basic cycles- Initiating phase, planning phase, executing phase, controlling phase, closing phase. I also learned that three factors affect in completion of a project- Time, money, and scope. </p>
    <p>In my personal and work life, I will use these principles to plan tasks more effectively. After initiating a project I will plan and execute it. I will also keep in mind about it's constraints. Whether it is personal or work related project, I will apply structured planning, risk management, and regular reviews to improve outcomes and effecincy.</p>
