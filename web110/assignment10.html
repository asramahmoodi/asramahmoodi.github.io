    <h1>assignment10-Internet Fundamentals/Multimedia and Graphics</h1>
    <p>In this session, I have learned about Multimedia and Graphics, Which involve creating images and animations using computers and their impact on various media such as movies, video games, etc. I found the difference between raster and vector graphics. Raster graphics are made of pixels and resolution dependants, whereas vector graphics use mathematical shapes and are ideal for scaling. I aso learned about multimedia like, text, audio, and video. I learned about html5 elements for embedding images, audio, and video in web pages. I also learned about lossy and lossless compression methods.
    In my personal and work environment, multimedia and graphics can play a significant role. In my personal environment, I can create content for learning, and entertainment. In my work environment,if I work for web development or app design, I can use images, audio, video, and animation to enhance my creativity on projects and to make it more impactful through clickable graphics, videos, or 3D models.
