    In this session, I have learned about Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), it's functionality, and how it is used to style and format web pages. CSS is used to separate content from presentation. This allows the same markup to be presented in multiple format. Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow for conditional styling, such as changing the appearance of elements when hovered over or when they are in certain states(eg, links can be visited). Pseudo-elements allow us to style parts of anelements, such as first letter of first line of a paragraph. Combinators, combines selector in various ways to target element based on their relation to other elements in the document structure.
    I can apply this learning to style my personal website or portfolio. In my work environment, CSS learning will help me in building my own business, especially making websites or offering web-related services or I can sell products, offer services, or share content.
