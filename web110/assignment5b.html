    <p>activity-1-Chrome Remote Desktop
    In this activity, I learned about chrome remote desktopuses a special protocolthat let us control a computer remotely using a web browser or mobile app. We can access it through a web portal at remotedesktop.google.com, and it works on devices like smartphones(android, iOS) and desktops(windows, macOS,Linux, ChromeOS). To use chrome remote desktop, the computer we want to access needs a server package installed, and the connection is typically set up for permanent access with prior approval. It allows us to share oue screen, transfer keyboard and mouse actions, sunc the clipboard, and even transmit audio in real time on windows.
    In my personal environment, I can use chrome remote desktop to assist my family members or friends when there is technical issues, I can use it for quick and effective remote support. It eliminates the need for them to perform tasks like setting up a call, providing instructions, etc. In my professional environment, if I work from home or travel frequently, chrome remote desktop can help me access my office computers securely from any location to retrieve files, check emails, or use software that's installed only on my office machine. Chrome remote desktop can also facilitate quick tech support between colleagues. If my colleagues encounter an issue, I can access their computer remotely to fix it.</p>
