    <h1>Assignment1b - Internet Fundamentals (Introduction to Internet) </h1>
    <p> Activity Name: Manage Folders and Files.<br>
    Topic: Windows Basics- Working with Files.<br>
    What I have Learned about the Topic: I have learned about managing files and folders in windows operating system. Specifically , how to organize, view, move, delete, and rename files. It covers essential topics that helps me navigate and manage my digital work space effictively.
    How I can apply the concept to current and future environment:<br>
    I can use folders to organize my personal documents (like photos, notes, and other papers). For example, I might have a folder for "Work Documents," "Personal Projects," and "Travel Photos" to keep everything tidy.
   Renaming files in a consistent way will help me find them quickly later.
   If I am working in a company or organization, I can create specific folders for different clients, projects, or departments. 
   When working in a team, using shared folders can make easy collaboration . I can keep project files in the same location and organize them into subfolders for different stages of the project.
   I can Back up important files regularly by copying them to an external drive or cloud storage to ensure that my data is safe. Folders can be used to keep backups organized by category.
