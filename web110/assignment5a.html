    <p>Assignment 5a- Internet fundamentals/ social media
    Activity #1- Blog Basics.
    In this activity, I learned about blogs, bloggers, and the various reasons why people do blogging. Blogs are websites that can include text, photoes, videos, and other media. These posts reflect the interests and experiences of the bloggers, and most blogs are personal, written by individuals rather than teams. Bloggers write for many reasons, including sharing their expertise, expressing their opinions, advancing their careers, or simply as a hobby. Some people also blog to earn money through ads or selling products. I also learned about the different types of blogs, like personal, hobby, interest, political, photoblogs, and microblogs. Each type focuses on a specific topic or niche, and the content can vary greatly based on the bloggers goals and audience.
    In my personal environment, I can apply this knowledge by starting a blog to share my thoughts,hobbies, or experiences. I can use it as a creative outlet or to document my personal interest. In my professional environment, I can use blogging as atool to share my expertise, improve my writing skills, or even build a personal brand.
    Activity#2- Pinterest.
    In this activity, I learned that pinterest is a unique social network that serves as adigital bulletin board or scrapbook, where users can collect and organize content they find online. Unlike other social networks focused on personal updates, pinterest allows us to save items like recipes, ideas, and inspirations to virtual boards. Pins are linked to the original websites, creating a visual collection of bookmarks. Pinterest also allows users to follow other "pinners" and save their content to personal boards, helpingto discover and organize new idea easily.
    In my personal environment, I can apply pinterest to organize my interest, like saving recipes, travel ideas, or home decor ideas, making it easier to plan events. In my professional environment, I could use pinterest for organizing and collecting resources related to work projects or industry trends. For example, creating boards related to design inspiration, marketing strategies, or professional development could be useful.</p>
