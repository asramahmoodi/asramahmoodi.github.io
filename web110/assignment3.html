        Session#3 - Internet Fundamentals/search engines.
        Activity#1- search engine.
        In this activity I have learned that search engines are powerful tools that help users quickly find relevant information on the internet. They work by crawlimg websites, indexing content, and using algorithms to rank search results based on relevant and authority. The key features of a search engine include the crawler(or spider), the index, the search algorithm, and the user interface, each playing a crucial role in delivering accurate and fast results.
        Additionally, the concept of Search Engine Optimization(SEO) was highlighted, which focuses on improving the visibility of a website on search engines through technical, on-page and off-page strategies. Popular search engines like, Gogle, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, and DuckDuckGo each have unique features, such as privacy-focused searches or integration with other services.
        I would like to apply this knowledge in both my personal and professional environment. Personally understanding how search engines work can help me better navigate and utilize themimproving my ability to find the information I need. Professionally, I can take advantage of SEO techniques to enhance the visibilty of websites on work. Whether it's optimizing web pages for better search ranking or using search engines effectively for research and business decision.
